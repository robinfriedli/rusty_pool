/// Self growing / shrinking `ThreadPool` implementation based on crossbeam's
/// multi-producer multi-consumer channels that enables awaiting the result of a
/// task and offers async support.
///
/// This `ThreadPool` has two different pool sizes; a core pool size filled with
/// threads that live for as long as the channel and a max pool size which describes
/// the maximum amount of worker threads that may live at the same time.
/// Those additional non-core threads have a specific keep_alive time described when
/// creating the `ThreadPool` that defines how long such threads may be idle for
/// without receiving any work before giving up and terminating their work loop.
///
/// This `ThreadPool` does not spawn any threads until a task is submitted to it.
/// Then it will create a new thread for each task until the core pool size is full.
/// After that a new thread will only be created upon an `execute()` call if the
/// current pool is lower than the max pool size and there are no idle threads.
///
/// Functions like `evaluate()` and `complete()` return a `JoinHandle` that may be used
/// to await the result of a submitted task or future. JoinHandles may be sent to the
/// thread pool to create a task that blocks a worker thread until it receives the
/// result of the other task and then operates on the result. If the task panics the
/// `JoinHandle` receives a cancellation error. This is implemented using a futures
/// oneshot channel to communicate with the worker thread.
///
/// This `ThreadPool` may be used as a futures executor if the "async" feature is enabled,
/// which is the case by default. The "async" feature includes the `spawn()` and
/// `try_spawn()` functions which create a task that polls the future one by one and
/// creates a waker that re-submits the future to the pool when it can make progress.
/// Without the "async" feature, futures can simply be executed to completion using
/// the `complete` function, which simply blocks a worker thread until the future has
/// been polled to completion.
///
/// The "async" feature can be disabled if not need by adding the following to your
/// Cargo dependency:
/// ```toml
/// [dependencies.rusty_pool]
/// default-features = false
/// version = "*"
/// ```
///
/// When creating a new worker this `ThreadPool` tries to increment the worker count
/// using a compare-and-swap mechanism, if the increment fails because the total worker
/// count has been incremented to the specified limit (the core_size when trying to
/// create a core thread, else the max_size) by another thread, the pool tries to create
/// a non-core worker instead (if previously trying to create a core worker and no idle
/// worker exists) or sends the task to the channel instead. Panicking workers are always
/// cloned and replaced.
///
/// Locks are only used for the join functions to lock the `Condvar`, apart from that
/// this `ThreadPool` implementation fully relies on crossbeam and atomic operations.
/// This `ThreadPool` decides whether it is currently idle (and should fast-return
/// join attempts) by comparing the total worker count to the idle worker count, which
/// are two values stored in one `AtomicUsize` (both half the size of usize) making sure
/// that if both are updated they may be updated in a single atomic operation.
///
/// The thread pool and its crossbeam channel can be destroyed by using the shutdown
/// function, however that does not stop tasks that are already running but will
/// terminate the thread the next time it will try to fetch work from the channel.
/// The channel is only destroyed once all clones of the `ThreadPool` have been
/// shut down / dropped.
///
/// # Usage
/// Create a new `ThreadPool`:
/// ```rust
/// use rusty_pool::Builder;
/// use rusty_pool::ThreadPool;
/// // Create default `ThreadPool` configuration with the number of CPUs as core pool size
/// let pool = ThreadPool::default();
/// // Create a `ThreadPool` with default naming:

/// // using the Builder struct:
/// let pool4 = Builder::new().core_size(5).max_size(50).build();
/// ```
///
/// Submit a closure for execution in the `ThreadPool`:
/// ```rust
